#Scrimba Password Generator

One of the solo projects from Module 3. I followed the provided design and completed 2 stretch goals - adding a number input to let the user select a password length and making them clickable to copy the password to clipboard. I also researched css tooltips and used them to help clarify the copy functionality.
